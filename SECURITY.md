# Security Guidelines for Atlantic Leather

## 🔒 Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Atlantic Leather e-commerce platform and provides guidelines for maintaining security standards.

## 🚨 Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- ✅ Removed hardcoded database passwords
- ✅ Removed default admin credentials from login page
- ✅ Implemented proper JWT secret validation (minimum 32 characters)
- ✅ Added secure token storage with encryption
- ✅ Implemented automatic token refresh mechanism

### 2. **CORS Configuration**
- ✅ Restricted CORS to specific origins instead of allowing all (`*`)
- ✅ Configured proper headers and methods
- ✅ Added environment-based origin configuration

### 3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- ✅ Added comprehensive input sanitization middleware
- ✅ Implemented XSS protection
- ✅ Added SQL injection prevention measures
- ✅ Created validation rules for all input fields

### 4. **Security Headers**
- ✅ Enhanced Helmet configuration with CSP
- ✅ Added HSTS headers
- ✅ Implemented frame protection
- ✅ Added content type sniffing protection

### 5. **Logging & Debugging**
- ✅ Removed debug console.log statements from production code
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling without information leakage

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required - Must be at least 32 characters
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_must_be_at_least_32_chars_long
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_super_secret_refresh_key_here_must_be_at_least_32_chars_long

# Database
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password

# CORS (Production)
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain letters, numbers, and special characters
- No default passwords allowed

### Token Security
- Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- Tokens are encrypted before storage
- Automatic token refresh on expiration

## 🔍 Security Audit

Run the security audit script to check for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security-audit

# Run comprehensive security check
npm run security-check
```

## 🚫 Security Violations to Avoid

### Never Do:
- ❌ Hardcode passwords or secrets in code
- ❌ Use default credentials in production
- ❌ Allow CORS from all origins (`*`)
- ❌ Log sensitive information to console
- ❌ Use weak JWT secrets (< 32 characters)
- ❌ Store tokens in plain text
- ❌ Skip input validation
- ❌ Expose database credentials

### Always Do:
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Implement proper input validation
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Regular security audits
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Use secure headers
- ✅ Encrypt sensitive data

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Backend Security Middleware
- Helmet for security headers
- CORS with restricted origins
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Input sanitization
- JWT validation with proper secrets

### Frontend Security
- Secure token storage with encryption
- Automatic token refresh
- XSS protection
- CSP headers
- Secure API client

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deployment, ensure:

- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] JWT secrets are at least 32 characters
- [ ] Database passwords are secure
- [ ] Security audit passes
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled in production
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak information

## 🆘 Security Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Change all passwords and secrets
   - Revoke all active tokens
   - Check logs for suspicious activity

2. **Investigation**
   - Run security audit
   - Check for data breaches
   - Identify attack vectors

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security measures
   - Notify affected users if necessary
